      "paragraph1": "Relatronica was born in Switzerland in 2024 from the meeting, at CERN, between designers and researchers who share the same question: how can we use technologies and data to truly engage people in choices concerning humanity's future?",
      "paragraph2": "CERN is one of the symbols of international scientific collaboration. It was here, in 1991, that the World Wide Web was born, conceived as an open space to share knowledge and make information accessible to everyone. Since then, the Web has revolutionized our lives, but many crucial decisions – on climate, energy, research, infrastructure – are still perceived as distant, technical, poorly participated.",
      "paragraph3": "With Relatronica we want to carry forward and expand that original spirit: not just a Web where you read and inform yourself, but spaces and tools where people can understand, discuss and contribute. We transform complex topics into clear paths of participation, to bring citizens, institutions and scientific communities closer together."
