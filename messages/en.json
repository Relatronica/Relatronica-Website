      "paragraph2": "CERN is one of the symbols of international scientific collaboration. It was here, in 1991, that the World Wide Web was born, conceived as an open space to share knowledge and make information accessible to everyone. Since then, the Web has revolutionized our lives, but many crucial decisions – on climate, energy, research, infrastructure – are still perceived as distant, technical, poorly participated.",
      "paragraph3": "With Relatronica we want to carry forward and expand that original spirit: not just a Web where you read and inform yourself, but spaces and tools where people can understand, discuss and contribute. We transform complex topics into clear paths of participation, to bring citizens, institutions and scientific communities closer together."

    "preamble": "We live in an age where the future is narrated by those who have the power to shape it — often behind closed doors, often without consulting those who will bear the consequences. We believe that imagining the future is a political act, and that design is the tool to make it accessible to everyone. We are not prophets. We are designers, researchers and activists who believe in the power of the right questions, open tools and informed communities.",

        "title": "The future is a collective project",
        "body": "No algorithm, no government, no corporation should have a monopoly on imagination. The future belongs to those who inhabit it. That's why we design tools that enable communities to explore scenarios, compare possibilities and build shared visions. We refuse to accept that the future is a product to be sold."

        "title": "Technology must serve communities, not control them",

        "title": "Knowledge is power only when it is accessible",
        "body": "Data locked in a database does not change the world. Research locked in an academic paper does not inform citizens. We believe in knowledge mapping as a practice of democratisation: making visible what is hidden, connecting what seems isolated, translating complexity into understanding."
      },
      "p4": {
        "title": "Design must provoke, not just solve",
        "body": "Speculative design does not seek immediate solutions — it seeks the questions we have not yet asked. A good future scenario is not one that predicts correctly, but one that changes how we think about the present. We design to disturb the comfort of inevitability."

        "title": "Activism is built with tools",
        "body": "Words matter, but tools matter more. A well-designed infographic can change a public debate. A data visualisation can unmask an injustice. An open platform can give voice to the voiceless. We don't just denounce — we build the alternatives."

        "title": "Connections matter more than isolated data",
        "body": "A climate event, a political decision and a technological innovation may seem unrelated — until you map their relationships.

      "p8": {
        "title": "Dissent is design",
        "body": "Refusing the future imposed on us is the first act of design. Saying \"this is not inevitable\" is design. Saying \"an alternative exists\" is design. Saying \"who bears the consequences?\" is design. Informed and constructive dissent is the engine of change."

      "p9": {
        "title": "We don't design for the future — we design the future",
